Okay, so I just stumbled out of the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Deva and I’m not entirely sure what planet I just landed on. Like, seriously, what was that? One moment I'm thinking it's this beautiful exploration of... I dunno, human spirit? Mystery? And the next I’m like, wait, did I just get hit by a whirlwind of scenes that even my inner pastry chef couldn't whip together?

I mean, don't get me wrong, there are these moments in the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 where the visuals almost enveloped me like a perfectly risen soufflé. Some scenes were just… BAM, in your face, colors and chaos, like that time I accidentally dropped an entire bag of flour on my dog...but artsier, you know? The director really went for that punch-you-in-the-gut kind of beauty. But sometimes I couldn’t help but feel like they're trying a bit too hard, like when my buddy tried to make foie gras cupcakes. Spoiler alert: foie gras DOES NOT belong in cupcakes.

> And the sound, oh boy, the sound. It was like they took a mix tape from the early 2000s, added some dramatic chanting, and called it a day. Kind of reminded me of that time I accidentally left my mixer on with nothing in the bowl. Just noise. Slightly... annoying? Yet sorta captivating. A little like the mysterious pull of eating cereal in the dead of night when your brain’s like don't, but your heart says do it.

Characters were a rollercoaster too. One minute they’re delivering lines that make you think they’ve got hidden depths and the next they’re pulling faces like a kid being told Santa isn’t real. And can we talk about the main character's hair? It’s like, wasn’t she in a rainstorm a scene ago? And yet here she is with hair smoother than buttercream.

Okay, random tech spasm, incoming. :
// Puzzle code moment from the  ?
void mysteriousFunction(int intenseScene) {
  while (intenseScene > 0) {
    cout << What is happening? << endl;
    intenseScene--;
  }
}

Even with all its quirks, I’d still say 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  . Or 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  . Or just, I dunno, experience it in your own way. It’s like that odd dessert that doesn’t look great, but you keep coming back to, just for the curiosity factor. Deva’s left me feeling a bit befuddled but in a way that’s weirdly inviting. Like I said, what a trip.
